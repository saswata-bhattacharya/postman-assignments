# Standard description
A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test scope, test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product. Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test. The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process, which is minutely monitored and controlled by the test manager.

As per ISTQB definition: _“Test Plan is A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.”_


## How to keep the audience in mind when creating a Test Plan?
Before you begin creating your test plan, you’ll need to identify your intended consumers and make sure their needs are being met. This will improve the quality of your test plan tenfold.

Here are the main things to ensure your test plan is:

* **Concise:** Your test plan should be no longer than one page with bullet points. 
* **Organized:** Make sure all the information is logically grouped. 
* **Readable:** The document should be easy to read, avoiding technical language where possible. 
* **Flexible:** Your test plan should be adaptable and not fixed in stone. You want to create documentation that won't hold you back if new information comes along or changes need to be made.
Accurate. Make sure all the information you've included is accurate.

## How to write a Test Plan?

To create a proper test plan, you need to follow the below steps: 

1. Analyze the product
2. Design the Test Strategy
3. Define the Test Objectives
4. Define Test Criteria
5. Resource Planning
6. Plan Test Environment
7. Schedule & Estimation
8. Determine Test Deliverables

# Area of application

QA Team.

When a team is planning for a release or a quarter, a proper test plan can help and guide a QA team to understand test scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities for a particular release or a quarter. 


# Mandatory
Yes/No

* It depends on the use cases. If a team is planning for a big release with multiple team involvement or planning for a quarter, test plan is really a good document to plan upcoming test activities.

* Not suitable for small release as it takes lots of time and input to create this document

<state whether this standard is mandatory for all applications, or if it depends on the usecase>
# Main justification
<describe why this standard is important. Does it contribute to security, cost-reduction, reliability, flexibility, operational excellence, performance, regulation>

## What is the Importance of Test Plan?
Making Test Plan document has multiple benefits

* Help people outside the test team such as developers, business managers, customers understand the details of testing.
* Test Plan guides our thinking. It is like a rule book, which needs to be followed.
* Important aspects like test estimation, test scope, test strategy are documented in Test Plan, so it can be reviewed by Management Team and re-used for other projects.

# Example
<provide examples, maybe both positive and negative, on how this standard would be implemented>
